/*
Social network connectivity. Given a social network containing n members 
and a log file containing m timestamps at which times pairs of members 
formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at 
which all members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a 
friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted 
by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running 
time of your algorithm should be mlog‚Å°nm \log nmlogn or better and use 
extra space proportional to n.
